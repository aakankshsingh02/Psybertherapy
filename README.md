# Video Calling Repository

This repository provides a simple and easy-to-use video calling solution that can be integrated into any web application. The solution is built on top of WebRTC technology and provides real-time, high-quality video and audio communication between participants.

## Installation

To use the video calling functionality in your web application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running the command ` install`.
3. Start the server by running the command `start`.

The video calling solution is now ready to use.

## Usage

To start a video call, navigate to the video calling page in your web application and click the "Start Call" button. This will generate a unique URL that can be shared with other participants to join the call.

To join a call, simply click on the unique URL generated by the host and enter your name to join the call. Once all participants have joined the call, the video and audio feeds will automatically start.

The video calling solution also allows participants to customize their user interface by changing their camera and microphone settings, adjusting their audio and video quality, and more.
