To join a call, simply click on the unique URL generated by the host and enter your name to join the call. Once all participants have joined the call, the video and audio feeds will automatically start.

The video calling solution also allows participants to customize their user interface by changing their camera and microphone settings, adjusting their audio and video quality, and more.
